# My Daily Clippings

Your personal AI newspaper, delivering fresh daily briefings across Physics, AI, Geopolitics, Astronomy, and more — every morning.

## What it is

My Daily Clippings is a personal newspaper built for one reader. Every morning at 6 AM IST, an AI agent scans the latest developments across your chosen topics and drafts a curated briefing in the style of a personal journal.

In an age where algorithms decide what you see based on what keeps you scrolling, this works differently. **You choose the subjects that expand your mind. The AI just does the reading.**

## How it works

1. **Generate** — A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily at 6 AM IST, calling Gemini 2.5 Flash with real-time web search to write newsletters for each category. Results are committed to the `newsletters/` folder.
2. **Deploy** — Every push to `master` triggers a second workflow that builds the Next.js static site and publishes it to GitHub Pages.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) — static site export
- [Gemini 2.5 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) — newsletter generation with web search grounding
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) — daily generation + deployment automation
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) — hosting

## Self-hosting

1. Fork this repo
2. Go to **Settings → Secrets → Actions** and add:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` — your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source** and set it to **GitHub Actions**
4. Push any change to `master` to trigger the first deploy
5. The daily generation will run automatically at 6 AM IST

## Adding categories

Edit two files:

**`scripts/categories.ts`** — add generation config (system prompt, search query)

**`src/lib/categories.ts`** — add display config (label, accent color, tagline)

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # start dev server at localhost:3000
npm run generate   # run newsletter generation locally (requires GEMINI_API_KEY env var)
npm run build      # build static site to ./out
```
